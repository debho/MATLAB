- Ines used their camera to record
- We forgot to record the moment the bio-logger was attached, but we do have when it was taken off (my watch is in view at the end)
- Since EEG is 250Hz, you can backout when the recording started and align the video to the raw data
- data.csv are int32 and type.csv are uint8
- ch1: Parietal, ch2: Frontal, ch3: NC, ch4: EMG
